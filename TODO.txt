Sprite constructor taking arbitrary number of file names.

Sprite.contains() -> by transparency? Multiple containment policies?

GUIsh: allow hierarchy of objects.

Add means to remove objects/handlers from GUIsh.

GUIsh what about z-order? Nodes have a "z" property; I can implement a
picking visitor that takes it into account. Then, GUIsh should use
this.

Create a "virtual screen" with a given "virtual size". Draw everything
relative to this virtual screen. Scale when drawing. But allow to use
"real pixels", too. (This would be an option when creating (or
re-creating, if possible) the display).

Child nodes call a parents' method to tell to update their bounding
boxes because their own bounding box changed. This way, we'll always
have updated bounding boxes.

Unit tests: addChild(), removeChild(). Consider what happens when the
same node is added as child twice.

Engine: consider using a mixin or whatever to encapsulate that
"create, test-and-perhaps-throw, scope" idiom.
