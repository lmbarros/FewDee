GUIsh what about z-order? Drawables have a "z" property; I can
implement a picking visitor that takes it into account. Then, GUIsh
should use this. --> should "z" be a property of Node? How would this
influence rendering order? Nope. "z" is Drawable's. Picking will pick
Drawables only (and return a node path!). OSGUIsh can work with any
node; will need to walk up the picked node path until finding a
registered node (or not).

Child nodes call a parents' method to tell to update their bounding
boxes because their own bounding box changed. This way, we'll always
have updated bounding boxes. [ initial implementation will always
recompute the AABB; this faster method will be implemented if deemed
necessary. ]

GUIsh: allow hierarchy of objects.

Sprite constructor taking arbitrary number of file names.

Sprite.contains() -> by transparency? Multiple containment policies?

Add means to remove objects/handlers from GUIsh.

Create a "virtual screen" with a given "virtual size". Draw everything
relative to this virtual screen. Scale when drawing. But allow to use
"real pixels", too. (This would be an option when creating (or
re-creating, if possible) the display).

Unit tests: addChild(), removeChild(). Consider what happens when the
same node is added as child twice.

Create some standard updaters... like alpha interpolation, color
interpolation. Perhaps sprite updater. Mover. Easing would be nice for
everything...

Create other interfaces: Rotationable (Sprite is), Colorable (Sprite
and Text are). Perhaps an "Alphable", if Colorable doesn't work as
such already.

Use x and y instead of top and left for Sprite and Text.

Think about a sane way to do manage Allegro resources.

Add Text vertical alignment.

What if a state gets two events in the same "turn" and calls
pushState() in both of them? (Practical example: the player presses
"ESC" to get to the "in-game menu" state , and in the same "turn" he
is killed by a bullet, which triggers a transition to the "game over"
state.) Using Allegro events to manage the stack of states could be of
any help?
